Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's speech to the UN went badly. The whole hemicycle left during his speech, but Russian television made a montage so that the population would believe that everyone was present. You can see this from the French representative's costume, which is different.
The Russian government is lying to its people. It is afraid of its reaction.
